Today's effort is for the opportunity to keep striving tomorrow.

Eighteen years of laying the foundation
======
Having studied for eighteen years in my hometown, Wuwei, Gansu, why do my eyes often well up with tears? Because I love this land deeply.

Three years of exploration
======
In my first year of undergraduate studies at Nankai University, I majored in Computer Science and Technology.
In my second year, I switched my major to Software Engineering and began research on large model changes in the field of intelligent operations and maintenance.
In my third year, I shifted my focus to research on generating embodied intelligence training environments.
